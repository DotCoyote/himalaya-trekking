        <h1>Welcome to Himalaya Trekking!</h1>

        <h2>My name is Santosh, and I can guide you!</h2>

        <p>
          I am a professional trekking guide with over 30 years of experience. I have been guiding trekkers from all
          over the world to the Himalayas. I have a deep knowledge of the mountains, the culture, and the people of the
          Himalayas. I can help you plan your trek, provide you with all the information you need, and guide you safely
          through the mountains.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether you are a seasoned trekker or a first-time visitor to the Himalayas, I can help you have an
          unforgettable experience. I offer a range of treks, from short day hikes to challenging high-altitude treks. I
          can also help you plan a custom trek that suits your interests, fitness level, and schedule.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am committed to providing you with a safe, enjoyable, and memorable trekking experience. I am passionate
          about the mountains and the people who live there, and I want to share that passion with you. I will do
          everything I can to ensure that you have a great time in the Himalayas and that you leave with wonderful
          memories that will last a lifetime.
